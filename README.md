_Welcome to the CSAP Coding Workshop! This is a safe, fun space to learn some pretty cool programmability! So kick back, update your cup of Java, and ENJOY!_

## Cisco Sample Code License

This license is free, enables our customers and partners to do everything they need to do with the code, but also provides Cisco the limitations and protections we need in order to keep the policy and process requirements for sample code sharing as lightweight and streamlined as possible.

**License:**  For all Cisco Sample Code postings*, we have the _Cisco Sample Code License_ in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) text file in the root of the repository.

**Header:**  _Every source code file_ must include the Cisco copyright and license notice [HEADER](./HEADER)

> **Note:**  For single-file code sharing (like a GitHub GIST, e-mail, blog, message or post), including the header in the source code is sufficient (you do not have to include the full license text).


## Getting Started (TO DO)

To make getting started as simple as possible, we have provided some language and use-case specific [examples](./examples).


## Additional Docs

We have also provided examples for some common project [docs](./docs) (README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, etc.).
